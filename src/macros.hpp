/** This file contains a collection of macros that can be used in model related classes.
    The class only needs to have the following members:
    - For Push_undo : std::weak_ptr<DocUndoStack> m_undoStack;  this is a pointer to the undoStack
    - For Update_undo_redo: mutable QReadWriteLock m_lock; This is a lock that ensures safety in case of concurrent access. Note that the mutex must be
   recursive.

    See for example TimelineModel.

    Note that there also exists a version of update_undo_redo without the need for a lock (but prefer the mutex version where applicable)
